    <h1>SAMARRY ON VARIABLES AND STRINGS</h1>

    <p>PHP STRINGS AND VARIABLES Review Awesome work! We’ve covered a lot of material in this lesson,<br> so let'’'s review: Strings are collections of text that the computer treats as a single piece of data. <br>A string can be any length and contain any
        letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces surrounded by quotation marks.<br> In order to include certain characters inside strings we have to use escape sequences. <br>An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. <br>We can use the
        concatenation operator (.) to combine two strings into one. <br>Variables are a fundamental programming concept which allow us to easily reuse data in our code. <br>We declare a variable using the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name
        and then use the assignment operator (=) to give it a value. <br>PHP has variable parsing which allows us to include variables directly in our strings. <br>Once a variable has been assigned, we can change its value. <br>This is called reassignment.
        <br>We can create an alias for a variable, instead of just a copy, using the reference assignment operator (=&). <br>Operations to the right of the assignment operator will be evaluated before assignment takes place. <br>The concatenating assignment
        operator (.=) is a shorthand notation for reassigning a string variable to its current value appended with another string value.<br> If that was a lot to take in, don’t worry about memorizing everything right away. <br><br><br><br><br>Remember
        that when you want to explore more about the language, the documentation is a great place to get comfortable exploring.</p>
